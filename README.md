# sec-data-parsing

This code's purpose is to parse [unstructured] data from Def 14A schedules filed by US corporations with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
The goal is to retrieve ownership (institutional and individual) data from filling companies.
This code only works after the researcher has already compiled a list of Def 14A links from which the data to be parsed will be retrieved. In this code, the list of links is called "def14aLinks" (assuming the researcher has a similar list).
